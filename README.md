# The Carpate Show


Hello there,

Project during my year of training, here is one of the pages of the website that I realized for the company **GAJITIMAS**.

This page contains *spell cards* of the game that we can sort with an input.

Cards, title, and the path are stored in database which itself.

The design of this page is realized with :

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript for the manipulation of the dom (modal window)
* PHP to generate dynamically the cards

## Requirements

1. Use the **bdd.sql** file to copy tables and **SQL queries**
2. Use **XAMPP** or **MAMPP** to start the **Apache** server 

## Below a gif allowing to realize the design and the functionality of the web page
